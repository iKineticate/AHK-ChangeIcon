## ISSUES：

1.Only support changeing shortcuts icons，temporarily not supporting the replacement of non-.lnk icons(e.g. system icons, exe icons, etc.) for the time being

2.For security reasons, UWP and app shortcuts do not support restoring the default icon and opening the target directory directly.

3.The original icons of some shortcuts originated from the .ico in the application folder, which resulted in an incorrect judgment as replaced

4.Recommend a software that facilitates converting other photos into ICO icons(The image can be dragged intos the software and converted into icons)
